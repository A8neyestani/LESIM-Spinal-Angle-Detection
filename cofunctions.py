    This function takes as input two tuples of two tuples each, representing the start
    and end points of two lines in 2D space. It calculates the vectors corresponding
    to these lines, then the dot product and magnitudes of these vectors.
    It then calculates cos(theta) and uses the arccos function to find theta, then converts
    this from radians to degrees. Please note that the function above assumes that the lines
    are defined as ((x1, y1), (x2, y2)), where (x1, y1) is the start point and (x2, y2) is
    the end point of the line.
